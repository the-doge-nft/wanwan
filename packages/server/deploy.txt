- AUTH DOCKER: aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 937356057180.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
- BUILD IMAGE: docker build -t wanwan-dev-api
- TAG IMAGE: docker tag docker tag wanwan-dev-api:latest 937356057180.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wanwan-dev-api:latest

environments:
    - cinsts of VPC, subnets, security groups etc
    - ecs cluster, load balancer
    - if you deploy two services to the same environment, both services will share the same network and cluster

services:
    - a service is your code and all of the supporting infrastructure that is required to run it
    - manifest contains all of the knobs and toggles for the service (how much memory and CPU should be allocated to each copy of the service, how many copies of the service should be running etc)

jobs:
    - ephemeral ECS tasks that are triggered by an event. Once their work is done, the task terminates

pipeline:
    - release pipeline that deploys your service whenever you push to a git repository
    - setup a pipeline for a particular service to a test environment, runs automated testing, then deploys to the production env
